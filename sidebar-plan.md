Do these instead:

1. Review all the components and features of the current sidebar. Note that it drops the first integer from the decimal id as it only denotes the Course it belongs to, mathematical foundations 1, 2, or 3, but it only drops it in the display, as its redundant. The visual hierarchy denotes courses.

2. Dig into the api, and routing of the sidebar, and the logic it entails.

3. Craft a plan to retain those core features while replacing the current visual design elements / the type of the sidebar with the prebuilt "An inset sidebar with secondary navigation" npx shadcn@latest add sidebar-08

4. Replace default/pre-built logo with /home/jake/Developer/MA-Graph-View/MA-Logo.svg

Remove "Acme Inc" and "Enterprise" Can you tell me what these are called as components? Like I know its the company name, but like is that a header or nav title or what.
